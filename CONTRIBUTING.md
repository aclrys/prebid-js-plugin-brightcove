## Writing Tests

The prebid-js-plugin-brightcove plugin uses [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for unit tests. [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/)
provides mocks, stubs, and spies. [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) runs the tests and generates
code coverage reports at `coverage/Chrome 66.0.3359 (Mac OS X 10.12.6)/index.html` Note that the exact version numbers may be different for your browser.

Tests are stored in the `tests/e2e/auto` directory. 
They can be run with the following command:

- `gulp test` - run the test suite once 

Before a Pull Request will be considered for merge:

- All new and existing tests must pass
- Added or modified code must have greater than 50% coverage

### Test Guidelines
When you are adding code to prebid-js-plugin-brightcove, or modifying code that isn't covered by an existing test, test the code according to these guidelines:

- If the module you are working on is already partially tested by a file within the `tests/e2e/auto` directory, add tests to that file
- If the module does not have any tests, create a new test file
- Group tests in a `describe` block
- Test individual units of code within an `it` block
- When writing tests you may use ES2015 syntax if desired

### Test Examples
